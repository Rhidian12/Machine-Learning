# Machine-Learning

### Introduction
This is a personal project to learn how Machine Learning works. I first recreated the Machine Learning as we saw in Gameplay Programming. I will later try to research some more complex Machine Learning.

### Pathfinding AI (Finished around 25/07)
We have a map consisting of nodes:

![Map](https://github.com/Rhidian12/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Markdown/Map.png)

The goal for the AI is to find the best path from the start node (in this case: 0) to the end node (in this case: 10).

The only information the AI has at any given time is the following:
* At which node it is right now
* To which nodes can it go
* Is one of the connected nodes the end node
